	Make a window the active window. Additionally, focus on a widget of that window.
	On Windows OS, whenever a message box is closed, its tk.Toplevel or tk.Tk does not become active automatically.

	Solving this problem is not as straightforward as simply calling 'focus_force' on the window.
	If the user closes the window when its message box was open, the window cannot be made the active window.
	Because it has been closed! In which case, this function should do nothing.
